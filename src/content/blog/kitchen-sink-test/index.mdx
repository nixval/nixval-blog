## 1. Admonitions Test

Let's test if the custom callouts are working correctly.

:::tip[Pro Tip]
This is a tip with a custom title! It should be green.
:::

:::warning
Warning! Don't push to production on Friday. This should be yellow.
:::

:::danger
Critical Error. System failure imminent. This should be red.

## 2. Mathematics (KaTeX)

We need to ensure logic and algorithms render beautifully.

**Inline Math:** The formula is  = mc^2$.

**Block Math:**
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$
**Complex Logic:**

$$
\forall x \in \mathbb{R}, \exists y \in \mathbb{R} : y > x
$$

## 3. Image Zoom Test

Click the image below. It should expand (lightbox effect).

## 4. Code Block Test

Does the copy button work?

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, AstroDaisy!");
}
```
